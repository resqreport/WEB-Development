**HTML Lesson 1: Basic Structure & Essential Elements**. 
This lesson is designed to walk you through every step, with clear explanations, so you understand both the purpose of each element and how to use them. 
We'll cover what HTML is, why it's important, and build a simple webpage from scratch.

## **Introduction**

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. 
It's the language used to create the structure of webpages. Think of it as the **skeleton** of your website—the basic framework on which you build everything else. In this lesson, you'll learn:

- How an HTML document is structured.
- What the essential tags are and what they do.
- How to create your first simple webpage.

## **Step 1: Creating Your First HTML File**

1. **Open a Text Editor:**  
Use a code editor like **VS Code** or **Notepad++** both great because it highlights your code and helps with formatting.

2. **Save the File:**  
   - Go to **File > Save As**.
   - Name your file **index.html** (make sure the extension is `.html`, not `.txt`).
   - Choose a location where you can easily find it (like your Desktop).

## **Step 2: Writing the Basic HTML Structure**

Every HTML document starts with a basic structure. Let's build it step by step.

### **1. Declare the Document Type**

At the very top, type:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This tells your browser, "Hey, I'm using HTML5!" It ensures your page follows the latest web standards.

---

### **2. Open the HTML Tag**

Next, add:
```html
<html lang="en">
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - `<html>` is the root element of the webpage.
  - The attribute `lang="en"` tells the browser and search engines that the content is in English.

---

### **3. Create the Head Section**

Inside the `<html>` tag, create a `<head>` section:
```html
<head>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  The `<head>` contains **meta-information** about your page—information that isn't visible on the page but is important for the browser (like the title, character encoding, etc.).

---

### **4. Set the Character Encoding**

Inside the `<head>`, add:
```html
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This ensures that your webpage can display special characters (like accents, symbols, or emojis) correctly.

---

### **5. Make the Page Mobile-Friendly**

Next, add:
```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
- **Explanation:**  
  This line makes your webpage responsive, meaning it will adjust to different screen sizes (like on smartphones and tablets).

---

### **6. Set the Page Title**

Now, add a title:
```html
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  The `<title>` sets the name of your webpage, which appears in the browser's tab.

---

### **7. Create the Body Section**

After the `</head>` tag, open the `<body>` tag:
```html
<body>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  Everything inside the `<body>` tag is what users will see on your webpage.

---

## **Step 3: Adding Content to Your Webpage**

### **1. Add a Heading**

Inside the `<body>`, add a heading:
```html
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - `<h1>` is used for the main heading. It’s the largest heading, usually used as the title of your page.

---

### **2. Add a Paragraph**

Below the heading, add some text:
```html
    <p>Hello! My name is [Your Name], and this is my first webpage.</p>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - `<p>` is used for paragraphs (regular blocks of text).

---

### **3. Add a Link**

Now, add a clickable link:
```html
    <p>Check out my <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">favorite website</a>.</p>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - `<a>` is the anchor tag, used to create links.
  - `href="https://www.example.com"` tells the link where to go.
  - `target="_blank"` makes the link open in a new tab.

---

### **4. Close the Body and HTML Tags**

Finally, end your document with:
```html
</body>
</html>
```
- **Explanation:**  
  Always close your tags to tell the browser where your content ends.

---

## **Step 4: The Complete Code**

Putting it all together, your **index.html** file should look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is [Your Name], and this is my first webpage.</p>
    <p>Check out my <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">favorite website</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## **Practice Tasks for HTML Lesson 1**

1. **Create Your First Webpage:**
   - Follow the steps above and build your own `index.html` file.
   - Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name.
   - Change the link URL to a website you like.

2. **Experiment with Headings and Paragraphs:**
   - Add another heading (`<h2>` or `<h3>`) and a new paragraph.
   - Try different texts to see how the elements appear.

3. **Play with Attributes:**
   - Modify the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag (for example, change it to `lang="es"` for Spanish).
   - Change the `target` attribute in the `<a>` tag to see how it affects the link behavior.

4. **View Your Webpage:**
   - Open your `index.html` file in a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and see the result.

## **Conclusion**

In **HTML Lesson 1**, you learned:
- The structure of an HTML document.
- What essential tags are and their purposes.
- How to create a basic webpage with headings, paragraphs, and links.

In the next lesson (**CSS Lesson 1**), we'll start learning how to style this HTML page with CSS to make it look visually appealing.
