## **Introduction to CSS**

**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is used to control the appearance of your HTML elements—such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. While HTML gives your page structure, CSS makes it visually attractive.

In this lesson, you'll learn:

- What CSS is and why it’s important.
- Different ways to add CSS to your HTML.
- How to create and use an **external CSS file**.
- Basic CSS properties to style your webpage.

## **Step 1: Understanding the Ways to Add CSS**

There are three common ways to add CSS to an HTML document:

1. **Inline CSS:**  
   Add styles directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute.  
   **Example:**  
   ```html
   <h1 style="color: red;">Hello, World!</h1>
   ```  
   *Note:* This method is quick for testing but isn’t recommended for larger projects.

2. **Internal CSS:**  
   Include CSS inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML file.  
   **Example:**  
   ```html
   <head>
       <style>
           body {
               background-color: lightblue;
           }
       </style>
   </head>
   ```  
   *Note:* This keeps all styles in one place, but for larger projects, it can become messy.

3. **External CSS (Recommended):**  
   Create a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML. This method keeps your HTML and CSS separate, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.

## **Step 2: Creating an External CSS File**

### **A. Create the CSS File**

1. **Open your text editor** (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
2. **Create a new file** and save it as **style.css** (make sure the extension is `.css`).

### **B. Add Some Basic CSS**

In your **style.css** file, add the following code:
```css
/* Style for the entire page */
body {
    background-color: lightgray;  /* Sets the background color */
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  /* Sets the font for the text */
    color: #333;  /* Sets the text color */
}

/* Style for the main heading */
h1 {
    color: blue;  /* Sets the heading color */
    text-align: center;  /* Centers the heading */
}

/* Style for paragraphs */
p {
    font-size: 16px;  /* Sets the font size */
    line-height: 1.5;  /* Increases spacing between lines for readability */
}
```

## **Step 3: Linking Your CSS File to Your HTML**

Now, open the **index.html** file you created in HTML Lesson 1. Inside the `<head>` section, add a link to your CSS file:
```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
- The `<link>` tag tells the browser to load your **style.css** file and apply the styles to your HTML.

---

## **Step 4: Viewing the Result**

1. **Save both files** (index.html and style.css) in the same folder.
2. **Open index.html** in your web browser.
3. You should now see your webpage styled with the background color, text color, and fonts you defined in your CSS file.

## **Practice Tasks for CSS Lesson 1**

1. **Change the Background Color:**  
   - Modify the `background-color` in the `body` style in **style.css**.
   - Try different colors (e.g., `#f0f0f0`, `lightblue`, etc.) and see the effect.

2. **Style the Heading and Paragraph:**  
   - Change the `color` and `font-size` for `<h1>` and `<p>` in your CSS.
   - Experiment with `text-align` (try `left`, `center`, and `right`) for the heading.

3. **Add More CSS Properties:**  
   - Add a border to your `<h1>` using:
     ```css
     h1 {
         border: 2px solid black;
         padding: 10px;
     }
     ```
   - Experiment with `margin` to add space around your elements.
